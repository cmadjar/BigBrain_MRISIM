# BigBrain MRISIM

## BigBrain

The BigBrain is the brain of a 65 year old man with no neurological or psychiatric
diseases in clinical records at time of death. The brain was embedded in paraffin and
sectioned in 7404 coronal histological sections (20 microns), stained for cell bodies.
The BigBrain is the digitized reconstruction of the hi-res histological sections 
(20 microns isotropic).

## Dataset content

The volumes present in this dataset were generated using MRISIM from the 200um tissue classification and were used as inputs in the comparison study between CIVET-2.1 and FreeSurfer-6.0 for the extraction of 
cortical surfaces on high-resolution volume (0.2, 0.5, 1.0mm), with the BigBrain serving as the gold standard.

Those volumes have been derived from the BigBrain release 2015 
published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

## Reference and more information

The BigBrain dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the
teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich)
and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute).
